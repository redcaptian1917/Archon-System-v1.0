# This file is intentionally present.

# Its presence defines the 'core' directory as a
# "Regular Python Package." This is the highest-security
# package in the system, as it contains the CEO agent,
# the API Gateway, the Auth library, and the Master Toolset.
#
# This file is the "Praetorian Guard" that prevents
# "Namespace Hijacking" attacks against the system's "brain."

# ARCHON SYSTEM - AGENTS PACKAGE (vFINAL)
#
# This file is intentionally present, even if empty.
#
# Its presence defines the 'agents' directory as a
# "Regular Python Package" rather than an "Implicit
# Namespace Package" (PEP 420).
#
# This is a critical security measure to prevent
# "Namespace Hijacking" and ensure all system-critical
# submodules (core, crews) are loaded from this
# directory and *only* this directory.

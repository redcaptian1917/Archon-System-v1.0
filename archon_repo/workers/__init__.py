# ARCHON SYSTEM - WORKERS PACKAGE (vFINAL)
#
# This file is intentionally present.
#
# Its presence defines the 'workers' directory as a
# "Regular Python Package." This is a critical security
# measure to prevent "Namespace Hijacking" attacks against
# the "Archon-Ops" (hands/senses) agents, such as
# 'LocalDeviceAgent.py' and 'hardware_agent.py'.
#
# This file secures the "C2" (Command & Control) agents.

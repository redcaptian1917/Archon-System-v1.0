# This file is intentionally present.
#
# Its presence defines the 'workers/pi' directory as a
# "Regular Python Package." This is a critical security
# measure to prevent "Namespace Hijacking" attacks against
# the 'hardware_agent.py' (the "Hardware Worker").
#
# This file is the "Elite Sentry Guard" for the
# physical-layer C2 agent.

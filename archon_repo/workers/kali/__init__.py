# This file is intentionally present.
#
# Its presence defines the 'workers/kali' directory as a
# "Regular Python Package." This is a critical security
# measure to prevent "Namespace Hijacking" attacks against
# the 'LocalDeviceAgent.py' (the "Software Worker").
#
# This file is the "Sentry Guard" for the software C2 agent.
